## Project Overview

This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game, developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game provides an interactive and user-friendly experience where two players can take turns playing on the same device. The project demonstrates core front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive design, and basic game logic.

The application runs entirely on the client side, requires no external libraries, and is compatible with all modern web browsers.

## Objectives

* To design and develop a simple yet engaging web-based game
* To understand and apply JavaScript game logic and conditional statements
* To practice DOM manipulation and event-driven programming
* To create a responsive and visually appealing user interface
* To strengthen foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

---

## Key Features

* Two-Player Mode**: Allows two users to play alternately (Player X and Player O)
* Real-Time Game Updates: Board updates instantly after each move
* Win Detection: Automatically detects winning combinations
* Draw Detection: Identifies tie situations when no moves remain
* Game Reset Option: Restart the game without refreshing the page
* Responsive Design: Works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices
* Clean UI: Simple layout with clear visual feedback for players

## Tools and Technologies Used

* HTML5 – Structure and layout of the game board
* CSS3– Styling, layout design, and responsiveness
* JavaScript (ES6) – Game logic, user interaction, and DOM manipulation
* Web Browser – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or any modern browser for execution
* Code Editor – VS Code / Sublime Text / Atom (optional)

## Game Logic Overview

1. Initialize a 3×3 grid and set the starting player
2. Capture user clicks on grid cells
3. Update the cell with the current player's symbol (X or O)
4. Check for winning combinations after each move
5. Display the winner or draw message
6. Disable further moves once the game ends
7. Allow the game to be reset

---

## User Interface and Experience

* Minimalistic layout for easy understanding
* Visual distinction between Player X and Player O
* Status message showing current turn or game result
* Smooth transitions and hover effects for better interaction

---

## Testing and Validation

* Tested all possible win combinations
* Verified draw scenarios
* Ensured turn switching works correctly
* Checked responsiveness across different screen sizes

---

## Conclusion

The Tic Tac Toe web game project is a beginner-friendly yet effective demonstration of front-end web development skills. It highlights the use of core web technologies to build an interactive application while reinforcing logical thinking and UI design principles. This project serves as a strong foundation for developing more complex web-based games and applications in the future.
